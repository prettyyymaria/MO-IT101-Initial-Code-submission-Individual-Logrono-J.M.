# Overview

Welcome to the MotorPH Proposal! 


# Usage
To use the program, just open it in your preferred IDE and follow the instructions below. The program's interface will guide you through the process, as it mainly operates using a numeric control system. Enter the numeric commands as directed to navigate and interact with the program's features.

# Instructions
- Once you’ve selected the Employee Number, enter the number of days they have worked or will work (the system uses HH:MM format and Military Time).
- Next, you will have the option to print the Payslip (enter Y to print it, or N to skip this step).
- If you choose Y, you’ll be given the option to repeat the process (enter Y to repeat or N to exit the program).
